                Listen, I could sit here and tell you that I am a software engineering student, with a passion
                for web development, cybersecurity and general tech. And while that's all true, my experience and 
                resume should already tell you that. So instead, let me tell you about me. I am a huge fan of
                video games. I started playing them when I was around 8 years old when I got Pokemon Emerald for 
                christmas. At the time, I couldn't speak english, and the games didn't have a portuguese option
                so I would constantly nag my dad to translate the text for me, and I'd watch tutorials on how to
                progress in the game. Ever since then, I've been hooked.

            <p class="content text-[wheat] text-lg text-justify indent-8">
                Despite my love for the main pokemon games, I mostly play multiplayer games. I've played a lot of 
                League of Legends, Valorant, World of Warcraft, to name a few. I love to get deep into the lore 
                of the games, the setting the creators envision for the game, and the characters that inhabit it. 
                A bit of a lore nerd, if you will. (⌐⊙_⊙)

                I dream of one day making a story that captivates others like I was captivated by these fantastical 
                worlds. Where I can bring my imagination to life, to turn reality all the lands I've dreamt of.
                Creativity is exactly what made me pursue programming as a whole. Computers allow us to communicate  
                with each other, allow us to create stories and characters, allow us to find anything about everything. 
                The multitude of options gives freedom to explore whatever area we desire and to create anything 
                out of 1's and 0's. I can find my own solutions, and they may be wrong most of the time because someone 
                already made a better version of it, but that only motivates me to better myself. To pursue the infinite.

                showing an interest into who I am. I know I'm not the most unique person, I know I'm not the most interesting 
                person as well. But thank you for reading. Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss WoW or LoL lore, I 
                AM AVAILABLE.
